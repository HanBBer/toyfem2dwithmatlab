### This version is safe when we do not treat with Neumann boundary Condition

###  This Project is designed for solving PDEs with finite element method on rectangle region
It contains the below functions:
1. A mesh generator with basic data structure (Realized as RecMesh, the RecMesh0 is a simpler demo)
2. A P1 Solver who play a role in mesh movement (femtoydemo is one simple demo)
3. A P2 Solver which assembles the stiffness matrix and load vector
4. A NS demo
5. Pack up all the function

All this work was built with a lot reference from the book *Understanding And Implementing The Finite Element*
